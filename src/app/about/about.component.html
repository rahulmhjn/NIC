    <p class="card-text" style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;padding-bottom: 50px;padding-top: 20px" >In order to utilise and harness the benefits of Cloud Computing, Government of India has embarked upon an ambitious initiative - "GI Cloud" which has been named as "MeghRaj". The focus of this initiative is to accelerate delivery of e-services in the country while optimizing ICT spending of the Government. This will ensure optimum utilization of the infrastructure and speed up the development and deployment of eGov applications. The architectural vision of GI Cloud encompasses a set of discrete cloud computing environments spread across multiple locations, built on existing or new (augmented) infrastructure, following a set of common protocols, guidelines and standards issued by the Government of India. Two Policy reports viz., "GI Cloud Strategic Direction Paper" and "GI Cloud Adoption and Implementation Roadmap" have been prepared by DeitY. The reports are available at: <a href="http://meity.gov.in/content/gi-cloud-meghraj">http://meity.gov.in/content/gi-cloud-meghraj</a> for download.</p>
